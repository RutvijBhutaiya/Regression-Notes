# Regression-Notes

1.	Linear Regression:
-	Relationship between observers and outcome – straight line. 
-	Root mean squared error and Gradient decent is used for best fit line. 
-	Polynomial regression (not a straight line) is used when relationship between observers and outcome is at nth degree, and method is useful when large number of observations are in curve series. 

2.	R- Squared: R2 tells how line fits the data better than mean.  R2 is percentage of variation explained by the relationship between variables (2 or more in multi regression).  If R2 is 80% then we can say that regression lines are 80% less variation than mean. Also, that relationship between variables waits 80% of variation. And hence, 80% of data is explained by the variable’s relationship. 

3.	L1 and L2 Regulation:
